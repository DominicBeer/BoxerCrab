# BoxerCrab

2 projects : 
- SpaceStore, a library for fast bounding box clash detection using a space hashing algorithm
- BoxerCrabGH, a Grasshopper plugin to open up the functionality of SpaceStore. It is intended to be used as a first step when trying to find clashes/intersections between large groups of objects - quickly filtering out any geometries whose bounding boxes don't intersect reduces the number of expensive intersection tests that need to be performed.

Still in the development phase...
